# Installation

**Ideally** To install the library, run the following command:

```bash
pip install prov4ml
```

For now, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HPCI-Lab/ProvML.git
cd ProvML
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or simply:

```bash
pip install --no-cache-dir git+https://github.com/HPCI-Lab/ProvML@mlflow_detach
```
